## About the Repository

The name **clean** was chosen after many unsuccessful attempts to configure and make the project work correctly. Once the solution was found using **OpenRouter** and the project was verified to function as intended, the decision was made to create a new, clean repository.

This repository was created with the goal of providing clarity in the code, ease of understanding, and an improved structure for the project.

# Hyperliquid Deepresearch Agent

## Overview

An autonomous trading agent for Hyperliquid that combines deep research with automated execution. The agent:

- Conducts thorough market research using OpenRouter API with GPT-based models
- Analyzes market sentiment and directional bias
- Evaluates sector-specific opportunities (e.g., DeFi, L1s, AI)
- Identifies promising assets aligned with market conditions
- Implements technical analysis for entry/exit strategies
- Manages position sizing and risk
- Executes trades automatically
- Push notifications via Telegram

## Key Features

### RAG-Enhanced Decision Making

- Learns from historical research data
- Tracks performance of past coin selections
- Incorporates historical trade PnL for strategy refinement

### Models Used
The agent leverages the **OpenRouter API** with models such as:
- `gpt-4-turbo`: Used for advanced market research and sentiment analysis
- `gpt-3.5-turbo`: Used for faster, cost-efficient research tasks
- Additional models can be configured via the `agentConfig.json` file.

### Current Limitations

- Uses custom AI integration (no native OpenAI function calling)
- Research costs can be significant
- Simple JSON-based data storage
- Built in JavaScript (for better or worse ðŸ˜‰)

### Roadmap

- Portfolio performance monitoring
- Enhanced agent customization options
  - Adjustable research frequency

## Setup Requirements
